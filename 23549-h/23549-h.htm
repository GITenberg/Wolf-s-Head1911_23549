      It might well be called the country of the outlaw, this vast tract of
      dense mountain forests and craggy ravines, this congeries of swirling
      torrents and cataracts and rapids. Here wild beasts lurked out their
      savage lives, subsisting by fang and prey,&mdash;the panther, the bear,
      the catamount, the wolf,&mdash;and like unto them, ferocious and fugitive,
      both fearsome and afraid, the man with a &ldquo;wolf&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; on which was set a
      price, even as the State&rsquo;s bounty for the scalps of the ravening brutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      One gloomy October afternoon, the zest of a group of sportsmen, who had
      pitched their camp in this sequestered wilderness, suffered an abatement
      on the discovery of the repute of the region and the possibility of being
      summoned to serve on a sheriff&rsquo;s posse in the discharge of the grimmest of
      duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is no outlaw in the proper sense of the term. The phrase has
      survived, but the fact is obsolete,&rdquo; said Seymour, who was both a prig and
      a purist, a man of leisure, and bookish, but a good shot, and vain of his
      sylvan accomplishments. &ldquo;Our law places no man beyond the pale of its
      protection. He has a constitutional right to plead his case in court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the reward offered to hale him forth and force him to enjoy that
      privilege&mdash;five hundred dollars?&rdquo; asked Bygrave, who was a newspaper
      man and had a habit of easy satire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he would never suffer himself to be taken alive.&rdquo; Purcell&rsquo;s
      vocation was that of a broker, and he was given to the discrimination of
      chances and relative values. &ldquo;Therefore he is as definitely <i>caput
      lupinum</i> as any outlaw of old. Nobody would be held accountable for
      cracking his &lsquo;wolf&rsquo;s head&rsquo; off, in the effort to arrest him for the sake
      of the five hundred dollars. But, meantime, how does the fellow contrive
      to live!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jes by his rifle, I reckon,&rdquo; replied the rural gossip whom intrusive
      curiosity occasionally lured to their camp-fire. &ldquo;Though sence that thar
      big reward hev been n&rsquo;ised abroad, I&rsquo;d think he&rsquo;d be plumb afraid ter fire
      a shot. The echoes be mighty peart these dumb, damp fall days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old jeans-clad mountaineer had a certain keen spryness of aspect,
      despite his bent knees and stooped shoulders. His deeply grooved, narrow,
      thin face was yet more elongated by the extension of a high forehead into
      a bald crown, for he wore his broad wool hat on the back of his head.
      There was something in his countenance not dissimilar to the facial
      contour of a grasshopper, and the suggestion was heightened by his
      persistent, rasping chirp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what frets Meddy; she can&rsquo;t abide the idee of huntin&rsquo; a human with
      sech special coursers ez money reward. She &lsquo;lows it mought tempt a&rsquo; evil
      man or a&rsquo; ignorant one ter swear a miser&rsquo;ble wretch&rsquo;s life away. Let the
      law strengthen its own hands&mdash;that&rsquo;s what Meddy say. Don&rsquo;t kindle the
      sperit of Cain in every brother&rsquo;s breast. Oh, Meddy is plumb comical
      whenst she fairly gits ter goin&rsquo;, though it&rsquo;s all on account of that thar
      man what war growed up in a tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dryadic suggestions of a dendroidal captivity flashed into Seymour&rsquo;s
      mind with the phrase, and stimulated his curiosity as to some quaint rural
      perversion of the legend.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was grim fact that the old mountaineer detailed in answer to the
      question, as he sat on a log by the fire, while the sportsmen lay on the
      ground about it and idly listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day&mdash;&lsquo;t war &lsquo;bout two year&rsquo; ago&mdash;thar war a valley-man up
      hyar a-huntin&rsquo; in the mountings with some other fellers, an&rsquo; toward sunset
      he war a-waitin&rsquo; at a stand on a deer-path up thar nigh Headlong Creek,
      hopin&rsquo; ter git a shot whenst the deer went down to drink. Waal, I reckon
      luck war ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; him, fer he got nuthin&rsquo; but durned tired. So, ez he
      waited, he grounded his rifle, an&rsquo; leaned himself ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; a great big tree
      ter rest his bones. And presently he jes happened ter turn his head, an&rsquo;,
      folks! he seen a sight! Fer thar, right close ter his cheek, he looked
      into a skellington&rsquo;s eye-sockets. Thar war a skellington&rsquo;s grisly face
      peerin&rsquo; at him through a crack in the bark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The raconteur suddenly stopped short, while the group remained silent in
      expectancy. The camp-fire, with its elastic, leaping flames, had bepainted
      the darkening avenues of the russet woods with long, fibrous strokes of
      red and yellow, as with a brush scant of color. The autumnal air was dank,
      with subtle shivers. A precipice was not far distant on the western side,
      and there the darksome forest fell away, showing above the massive, purple
      mountains a section of sky in a heightened clarity of tint, a suave,
      saffron hue, with one horizontal bar of vivid vermilion that lured the
      eye. The old mountaineer gazed retrospectively at it as he resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal, sirs, that town-man had never consorted with sech ez skellingtons.
      He lit out straight! He made tracks! He never stopped till he reached
      Colbury, an&rsquo; thar he told his tale. Then the sheriff he tuk a hand in the
      game. Skellingtons, he said, didn&rsquo;t grow on trees spontaneous, an&rsquo; he hed
      an official interes&rsquo; in human relics out o&rsquo; place. So he kem,&mdash;the
      tree is &lsquo;twixt hyar an&rsquo; my house thar on the rise,&mdash;an&rsquo;, folks! the
      tale war plain. Some man chased off &lsquo;n the face of the yearth, hid out
      from the law,&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way Meddy takes it,&mdash;he hed clomb the
      tree, an&rsquo; it bein&rsquo; holler, he drapped down inside it, thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; course
      he could git out the way he went in. But, no! It monght hev been deeper &lsquo;n
      he calculated, or mo&rsquo; narrow, but he couldn&rsquo;t make the rise. He died still
      strugglin&rsquo;, fer his long, bony fingers war gripped in the wood&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      rotted a deal sence then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was the man?&rdquo; asked Seymour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody knows,&mdash;nobody keers &lsquo;cept&rsquo; Meddy. She hev wep&rsquo; a bushel o&rsquo; 
      tears about him. The cor&rsquo;ner &lsquo;lowed from the old-fashioned flint-lock
      rifle he hed with him that it mus&rsquo; hev happened nigh a hunderd years ago.
      Meddy she will git ter studyin&rsquo; on that of a winter night, an&rsquo; how the
      woman that keered fer him mus&rsquo; hev watched an&rsquo; waited fer him, an&rsquo; &lsquo;lowed
      he war deceitful an&rsquo; de-sertin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; mebbe held a gredge agin him, whilst
      he war dyin&rsquo; so pitiful an&rsquo; helpless, walled up in that tree. Then Meddy
      will tune up agin, an&rsquo; mighty nigh cry her eyes out. He warn&rsquo;t even graced
      with a death-bed ter breathe his last; Meddy air partic&rsquo;lar afflicted that
      he hed ter die afoot.&rdquo; Old Kettison glanced about the circle, consciously
      facetious, his heavily grooved face distended in a mocking grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A horrible fate!&rdquo; exclaimed Seymour, with a half-shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edzac&rsquo;ly,&rdquo; the old mountaineer assented easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name&mdash;Meggy?&rdquo; asked the journalist, with a mechanical
      aptitude for detail, no definite curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw; Meddy&mdash;short fer Meddlesome. Her right name is Clementina
      Haddox; but I reckon every livin&rsquo; soul hev forgot&rsquo; it but me. She is jes
      Meddlesome by name, an&rsquo; meddlesome by natur&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly turned, gazing up the steep, wooded slope with an expectant
      mien, for the gentle rustling amidst the dense, red leaves of the
      sumac-bushes heralded an approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That mus&rsquo; be Meddy now,&rdquo; he commented, &ldquo;with her salt-risin&rsquo; bread. She
      lowed she war goin&rsquo; ter fetch you-uns some whenst I tol&rsquo; her you-uns war
      lackin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the camp-hunt had already been signalized by divers disasters: the
      store of loaves in the wagon had been soaked by an inopportune shower; the
      young mountaineer who had combined the offices of guide and cook was the
      victim of an accidental discharge of a fowling-piece, receiving a load of
      bird-shot full in his face. Though his injury was slight, he had returned
      home, promising to supply his place by sending his brother, who had not
      yet arrived. Purcell&rsquo;s boast that he could bake ash-cake proved a bluff,
      and although the party could and did broil bacon and even birds on the
      coals, they were reduced to the extremity of need for the staff of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence they were predisposed in the ministrant&rsquo;s favor as she appeared, and
      were surprised to find that Meddlesome, instead of masterful and
      middle-aged, was a girl of eighteen, looking very shy and appealing as she
      paused on the verge of the flaring sumac copse, one hand lifted to a
      swaying bough, the other arm sustaining a basket. Even her coarse gown
      lent itself to pleasing effect, since its dull-brown hue composed well
      with the red and russet glow of the leaves about her, and its short waist,
      close sleeves, and scant skirt, reaching to the instep, the immemorial
      fashion of the hills, were less of a grotesque rusticity since there was
      prevalent elsewhere a vogue of quasi-Empire modes, of which the cut of her
      garb was reminiscent. A saffron kerchief about her throat had in its folds
      a necklace of over-cup acorns in three strands, and her hair, meekly
      parted on her forehead, was of a lustrous brown, and fell in heavy
      undulations on her shoulders. There was a delicate but distinct tracery of
      bine veins in her milky-white complexion, and she might have seemed
      eminently calculated for meddling disastrously with the peace of mind of
      the mountain youth were it not for the preoccupied expression of her eyes.
      Though large, brown and long-lashed, they were full of care and
      perplexity, and a frowning, disconcerted line between her eye-brows was so
      marked as almost to throw her face out of drawing. Troubled about many
      things, evidently, was Meddlesome. She could not even delegate the opening
      of a basket that her little brother had brought and placed beside the
      camp-fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Gran&rsquo;dad,&rdquo; she exclaimed suddenly, stepping alertly forward&mdash;&ldquo;<i>don&rsquo;t</i>
      put that loaf in that thar bread-box; the box &lsquo;pears ter be damp. Leave
      the loaf in the big basket till ter-morrer. It&rsquo;ll eat shorter then, bein&rsquo; 
      fraish-baked. They kin hev these biscuits fer supper,&rdquo;&mdash;dropping on
      one knee and setting forth on the cloth, from the basket on her arm, some
      thick soggy-looking lumps of dough,&mdash;&ldquo;I baked some dodgers, too&mdash;four,
      six, eight, ten,&rdquo;&mdash;she was counting a dozen golden-brown cates of
      delectable aspect&mdash;&ldquo;knowin&rsquo; they would hone fer cornmeal arter
      huntin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; nuthin&rsquo; else nohow air fitten ter eat with feesh or aigs. Hev
      you-uns got any aigs!&rdquo; She sprang up, and, standing on agile tiptoe,
      peered without ceremony into their wagon. Instantly she recoiled with a
      cry of horrified reproach. &ldquo;Thar &lsquo;s ants in yer short-sweetenin&rsquo;! How <i>could</i>
      you-uns let sechez that happen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, surely not,&rdquo; exclaimed Purcell, hastening to her side. But the fact
      could not be gainsaid; the neglected sugar was spoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meddlesome&rsquo;s unwarranted intrusion into the arcana of their domestic
      concerns disclosed other shortcomings. &ldquo;Why n&rsquo;t ye keep the top on yer
      coffee-can? Don&rsquo;t ye know the coffee will lose heart, settin&rsquo; open?&rdquo; She
      repaired this oversight with a deft touch, and then proceeded: &ldquo;We-uns
      ain&rsquo;t got no short-sweetenin&rsquo; at our house, but I&rsquo;ll send my leetle
      brother ter fetch some long-sweetenin&rsquo; fer yer coffee ter night. Hyar,
      Sol,&rdquo;&mdash;addressing the small, limber, tow-headed, barefooted boy, a
      ludicrous miniature of a man in long, loose, brown-jeans trousers
      supported by a single suspender over an unbleached cotton shirt,&mdash;&ldquo;run
      ter the house an&rsquo; fetch the sorghum-jug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Sol started off with the alertness of a scurrying rabbit, she shrilly
      called out in a frenzy of warning: &ldquo;Go the other way, Sol&mdash;up through
      the pawpaws! Them cherty rocks will cut yer feet like a knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sol had nerves of his own. Her sharp cry had caused him to spring
      precipitately backward, frightened, but uncomprehending his danger. Being
      unhurt, he was resentful&rsquo; &ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t none o&rsquo; <i>yer</i> feet, nohow,&rdquo; he
      grumbled, making a fresh start at less speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Sol,&rdquo; said the old grandfather, enjoying the contretemps and the
      sentiment of revolt against Meddlesome&rsquo;s iron rule. &ldquo;Everything belongs
      ter Meddlesome one way or another, &lsquo;ca&rsquo;se she jes makes it hern. So take
      keer of <i>yer</i> feet for <i>her</i> sake.&rdquo; He turned toward her
      jocosely as the small emissary disappeared among the undergrowth. &ldquo;I jes
      been tellin&rsquo; these hunter-men, Meddy, &lsquo;bout how ye sets yerself even ter
      meddle with other folkses&rsquo; mourning&mdash;what they got through with a
      hunderd year&rsquo; ago&mdash;tormentatin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout that thar man what war starved
      in the tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard him, doubtless, for a rising flush betokened her deprecation of
      this ridicule in the presence of these strangers. But it was rather that
      she remembered his words afterward than heeded them now. It would seem
      that certain incidents, insignificant in themselves, are the pivots on
      which turns the scheme of fate. She could not imagine that upon her action
      in the next few seconds depended grave potentialities in more lives than
      one. On the contrary, her deliberations were of a trivial subject, even
      ludicrous in any other estimation than her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sol was small, she argued within herself, the jug was large and sticky. He
      might be tempted to lighten it, for Sol had saccharine predilections, and
      the helpless Jug was at his mercy. Sol had scant judgment and one suit of
      clothes available; the other, sopping wet from the wash, now swayed in the
      process of drying on an elder-bush in the dooryard. Should his integrity
      succumb, and the jug tilt too far, the stream of sorghum might inundate
      his raiment, and the catastrophe would place him beyond the pale of polite
      society. The seclusion of bed would be the only place for Sol till such
      time as the elder-bush should bear the fruit of dry clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Sol!&rdquo; she exclaimed, her prophetic sympathy bridging the chasm
      between possibility and accomplished fact. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch the jug myself.
      I&rsquo;ll take the short cut an&rsquo; head him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus she set her feet in the path of her future. It led her into dense,
      tangled woods, clambering over outcropping ledges and boulders. By the
      flare of the west she guided her progress straight to the east till she
      reached the banks of Headlong Creek on its tumultuous course down the
      mountainside. In her hasty enterprise she had not counted on crossing it,
      but Meddlesome rarely turned back. She was strong and active, and after a
      moment&rsquo;s hesitation, she was springing from one to another of the great,
      half-submerged boulders amidst the whirl of the transparent crystal-brown
      water, with its fleck and fringe of white foam. More than once, to evade
      the dizzying effect of the sinuous motion and the continuous roar, she
      stood still in midstream and gazed upward or at the opposite bank. The
      woods were dense on the slope. All in red and yellow and variant russet
      and brown tints, the canopy of the forest foliage was impenetrable. The
      great, dark boles of oak and gum and spruce contrasted sharply with the
      white and greenish-gray trunks of beeches and sycamore and poplar, and,
      thus breaking the monotony, gave long, almost illimitable avenues of
      sylvan vistas. She noted amidst a growth of willows on the opposite bank,
      at the waters-edge, a spring, a circular, rock-bound reservoir; in the
      marshy margin she could see the imprints of the cleft hoofs of deer, and
      thence ran the indefinite trail known as a deer-path. The dense covert
      along the steep slope was a famous &ldquo;deer-stand,&rdquo; and there many a fine
      buck had been killed. All at once she was reminded of the storied tree
      hard by, the tragedy of which she had often bewept.
    </p>
    <p>
      There it stood, dead itself, weird, phantasmal, as befitted the housing of
      so drear a fate. Its branches now bore no leaves. The lightnings of a
      last-year&rsquo;s storm had scorched out its vital force and riven the fibre of
      the wood. Here and there, too, the tooth of decay had gnawed fissures that
      the bark had not earlier known; and from one of these&mdash;she thought
      herself in a dream&mdash;a ghastly, white face looked out suddenly, and as
      suddenly vanished!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart gave one wild plunge, then it seemed to cease to beat She
      wondered afterward that she did not collapse, and sink into the plunging
      rapids to drown, beaten and bruised against the rocks. It was a muscular
      instinct that sustained her rather than a conscious impulse of
      self-preservation. Motionless, horrified, amazed, she could only gaze at
      the empty fissure of the tree on the slope. She could not then
      discriminate the wild, spectral imaginations that assailed her untutored
      mind. She could not remember these fantasies later. It was a relief so
      great that the anguish of the physical reaction was scarcely less poignant
      than the original shock when she realized that this face was not the
      grisly skeleton lineaments that had looked out thence heretofore, but was
      clothed with flesh, though gaunt, pallid, furtive. Once more, as she
      gazed, it appeared in a mere glimpse at the fissure, and in that instant a
      glance was interchanged. The next moment a hand appeared,&mdash;beckoning
      her to approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a gruesome mandate. She had scant choice. She did not doubt that
      this was the fugitive, the &ldquo;wolf&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; and should she turn to flee, he
      could stop her progress with a pistol-ball, for doubtless he would fancy
      her alert to disclose the discovery and share in the reward. Perhaps
      feminine curiosity aided fear; perhaps only her proclivity to find an
      employ in the management of others influenced her decision; though
      trembling in every fibre, she crossed the interval of water, and made her
      way up the slope. But when she reached the fateful tree it was she who
      spoke first. He cast so ravenous a glance at the basket on her arm that
      all his story of want and woe was revealed. Starvation had induced his
      disclosure of his identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s empty,&rdquo; she said, inverting the basket. She watched him flinch, and
      asked wonderingly, &ldquo;Is game skeerce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were at once forlorn and fierce. &ldquo;Oh, yes, powerful skeerce,&rdquo; he
      replied with a bitter laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an enigma in the rejoinder; she did not stay to read the riddle,
      but went on to possess the situation, according to her wont. &ldquo;Ye hev tuk a
      powerful pore place ter hide,&rdquo; she admonished him. &ldquo;This tree is a plumb
      cur&rsquo;osity. Gran&rsquo;dad Kettison war tellin&rsquo; some camp-hunters &lsquo;bout&rsquo;n it jes
      this evenin&rsquo;. Like ez not they&rsquo;ll kem ter view it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes dilated with a sudden accession of terror that seemed always
      a-smoulder. &ldquo;Lawd, Lawd, Lawd!&rdquo; he moaned wretchedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meddlesome was true to her name and tradition. &ldquo;Ye oughter hev remembered
      the Lawd &lsquo;fore ye done it,&rdquo; she said, with a repellent impulse; then she
      would have given much to recall the reproach. The man was desperate; his
      safety lay in her silence. A pistol-shot would secure it, and anger would
      limber the trigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not seem indignant. His eyes, intelligent and feverishly
      bright, gazed down at her only in obvious dismay and surprise. &ldquo;Done
      what?&rdquo; he asked, and as, prudence prevailing for once, she did not reply,
      he spoke for her. &ldquo;The murder, ye mean? Why, gal, I warn&rsquo;t even thar. I
      knowed nuthin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout it till later. Ez God is my helper and my hope, I
      warn&rsquo;t even thar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood astounded. &ldquo;Then why n&rsquo;t ye leave it ter men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t <i>prove</i> it ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; the murderers&rsquo; oaths. I had been consarned
      in the moonshinin&rsquo; that ended in murder, but <i>I</i> hed not been nigh
      the still fer a month,&mdash;I war out a-huntin&rsquo;&mdash;when the revenuers
      made the raid. There war a scrimmage &lsquo;twixt the raiders an&rsquo; the
      distillers, an&rsquo; an outsider that hed nuthin&rsquo; ter do with the Federal law&mdash;he
      war the constable o&rsquo; the deestrick, an&rsquo; jes rid with the gang ter see the
      fun or ter show them the way&mdash;he war killed. An&rsquo; account o&rsquo; <i>him</i>,
      the State law kem into the game. Them other moonshiners war captured, an&rsquo; 
      they swore ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; me &lsquo;bout the shootin&rsquo; ter save tharselves, but I hearn
      thar false oaths hev done them no good, they being held as accessory. An&rsquo; 
      I be so ez I can&rsquo;t prove an alibi&mdash;I can&rsquo;t <i>prove</i> it, though
      it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s truth. But before high heaven&rdquo;&mdash;he lifted his gaunt right
      hand&mdash;&ldquo;I am innercent, I am inner-cent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not have said why,&mdash;perhaps she realized afterward,&mdash;but
      she believed him absolutely, implicitly. A fervor of sympathy for his
      plight, of commiseration, surged up in her heart. &ldquo;I wisht it war so I
      could gin ye some pervisions,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;though ye do &lsquo;pear toler&rsquo;ble
      triflin&rsquo; ter lack game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the dread secret was told. &ldquo;Gal,&rdquo;&mdash;he used the word as a polite
      form of address, the equivalent of the more sophisticated &ldquo;lady,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;ef
      ye will believe me, all my ammunition is spent. Not a ca&rsquo;tridge lef&rsquo;, not
      a dust of powder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meddy caught both her hands to her lips to intercept and smother a cry of
      dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I snared a rabbit two days ago in a dead-fall. My knife-blade is bruk,
      but I reckon thar is enough lef&rsquo; ter split my jugular whenst the eend is
      kem at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl suddenly caught her faculties together. &ldquo;What sorter fool talk is
      that!&rdquo; she demanded sternly.&rsquo; &ldquo;Ye do my bid, ef ye knows what&rsquo;s good fer
      ye. Git out&rsquo;n this trap of a tree an&rsquo; hide &lsquo;mongst the crevices of the
      rocks till seben o &lsquo;clock ternight. Then kem up ter Gran&rsquo;dad Kettison&rsquo;s
      whenst it is cleverly dark an&rsquo; tap on the glass winder&mdash;not on the
      batten shutter. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll hev cartridges an&rsquo; powder an&rsquo; ball for ye&rsquo; an&rsquo; 
      some victuals ready, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the fugitive, despite his straits, demurred. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want ter git old
      man Kettison into trouble for lendin&rsquo; ter me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;T ain&rsquo;t his&rsquo;n. &lsquo;T is my dad&rsquo;s old buckshot ca&rsquo;tridges an&rsquo; powder an&rsquo; 
      ball. They belong ter me. The other childern is my half-brothers, bein&rsquo; my
      mother war married twice. Ye kin <i>steal</i> this gear from me, ef that
      will make ye feel easier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what will yer gran&rsquo;dad say ter me?&rdquo; &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t know who ye be; he will
      jes &lsquo;low ye air one o&rsquo; the boys who air always foolin&rsquo; away thar time
      visitin&rsquo; me an&rsquo; makin&rsquo; tallow-dips skeerce.&rdquo; The sudden gleam of mirth on
      her face was like an illuminating burst of sunshine, and somehow it cast
      an irradiation into the heart of the fugitive, for, after she was gone out
      of sight, he pondered upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the early dusk fell from a lowering sky, and the night came on
      beclouded and dark. Some turbulent spirit was loosed in the air, and the
      wind was wild. Great, surging masses of purple vapor came in a mad rout
      from the dank west and gathered above the massive and looming mountains.
      The woods bent and tossed and clashed their boughs in the riot, of gusts,
      the sere leaves were flying in clouds, and presently rain began to fall.
      The steady downpour increased in volume to torrents; then the broad,
      pervasive flashes of lightning showed, in lieu of myriad lines, an
      unbroken veil of steely gray swinging from the zenith, the white foam
      rebounding as the masses of water struck the earth. The camp equipage,
      tents and wagons succumbed beneath the fury of the tempest, and, indeed,
      the hunters had much ado to saddle their horses and grope their way along
      the bridle-path that led to old Kettison&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rude comfort of the interior had a heightened emphasis by reason of
      the elemental turmoils without. True, the rain beat in a deafening
      fusillade upon the roof, and the ostentation of the one glass window, a
      source of special pride to its owner, was at a temporary disadvantage in
      admitting the fierce and ghastly electric glare, so recurrent as to seem
      unintermittent. But the more genial illumination of hickory flames, red
      and yellow, was streaming from the great chimney-place, and before the
      broad hearth the guests were ensconced, their outstretched boots steaming
      in the heat. Strings of scarlet peppers, bunches of dried herbs, gourds of
      varied quaint shapes, hung swaying from the rafters. The old man&rsquo;s gay,
      senile chirp of welcome was echoed by his wife, a type of comely rustic
      age, who made much of the fact that, though housebound from &ldquo;rheumatics,&rdquo;
       she had reared her dead daughter&rsquo;s &ldquo;two orphin famblies,&rdquo; the said
      daughter having married twice, neither man &ldquo;bein&rsquo; of a lastin&rsquo; quality,&rdquo;
       as she seriously phrased it. Meddy, &ldquo;the eldest fambly,&rdquo; had been guide,
      philosopher, and friend to the swarm of youngsters, and even now, in the
      interests of peace and space and hearing, was seeking to herd them into an
      adjoining room, when a sudden stentorian hail from without rang through
      the splashing of the rain from the eaves, the crash of thunder among the
      &ldquo;balds&rdquo; of the mountains, with its lofty echoes, and the sonorous surging
      of the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light a tallow-dip, Meddy,&rdquo; cried old Kettison, excitedly. &ldquo;An&rsquo; fetch the
      candle on the porch so ez we-uns kin view who rides so late in sech a
      night &lsquo;fore we bid &lsquo;em ter light an&rsquo; hitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But these were travelers not to be gainsaid&mdash;the sheriff of the
      county and four stout fellows from the town of Colbury, summoned to his
      aid as a posse, all trooping in as if they owned the little premises.
      However, the officer permitted himself to unbend a trifle under the
      influence of a hospitable tender of home-made cherry-bounce, &ldquo;strong
      enough to walk from here to Colbury,&rdquo; according to the sheriff&rsquo;s
      appreciative phrase. He was a portly man, with a rolling, explanatory cant
      of his burly head and figure toward his interlocutor as he talked. His
      hair stood up in two tufts above his forehead, one on each side, and he
      had large, round, grayish eyes and a solemn, pondering expression. To
      Meddy, staring horror-stricken, he seemed as owlishly wise as he looked
      while he explained the object of his expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This district have got a poor reputation with the law, Mr. Kettison. Here
      is this fellow, Boyston McGurny, been about here two years, and a reward
      for five hundred dollars out for his arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Boy&rsquo;s fault, Sher&rsquo;ff, not our&rsquo;n,&rdquo; leered the glib old man. He,
      too, had had a sip of the stalwart cherry-bounce. &ldquo;Boy&rsquo;s in no wise
      sociable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s plumb flying in the face of the law,&rdquo; declared the officer. &ldquo;If I
      had a guide, I&rsquo;d not wait a minute, or if I could recognize the man whenst
      I viewed him. The constable promised to send a fellow to meet me here,&mdash;what&rsquo;s
      his name!&mdash;yes, Smith, Barton Smith,&mdash;who will guide us to where
      he was last glimpsed. I hope to take him alive.&rdquo; he added with an
      inflection of doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly this was a dreary camp-hunt, with all its distasteful sequelae.
      Purcell, who had no more imagination than a promissory note, silently
      sulked under the officer&rsquo;s intimation that, being able-bodied men, he
      would expect the hunters also to ride with him. They were not of his
      county, and doubted their obligation, but they would not refuse to aid the
      law. Bygrave, however, realized a &ldquo;story&rdquo; in the air, and Seymour was
      interested in the impending developments; for being a close observer, he
      had perceived that the girl was in the clutch of some tumultuous though
      covert agitation. Her blood blazed at fever-heat in her cheeks; her eyes
      were on fire; every muscle was tense; and her brain whirled. To her the
      crisis was tremendous. This was the result of her unwarranted
      interference. Who was she, indeed, that she should seek to command the
      march of events and deploy sequences? Her foolish maneuvering had lured
      this innocent man to ruin, capture, anguish, and death. No warning could
      he have; the window was opaque with the corrugations of the rainfall on
      the streaming panes, and set too high to afford him a glimpse from
      without. And, oh, how he would despise the traitor that she must needs
      seem to be! She had not a moment for reflection, for counsel, for action.
      Already the signal,&mdash;he was prompt at the tryst,&mdash;the sharp,
      crystalline vibration of the tap on the glass!
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff rose instantly with that cumbrous agility sometimes
      characterizing portly men. &ldquo;There he is now!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Meddy, with a little hysterical cry, had sprung first to the opening
      door. &ldquo;Barton Smith!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with shrill significance. &ldquo;Hyar is
      yer guide, Sher&rsquo;ff, wet ez a drownded rat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pale face in the dark aperture of the doorway, as the fire-light
      flashed on it, grew ghastly white with terror and lean with amazement. For
      a moment the man seemed petrified. Seymour, vaguely fumbling with his
      suspicions, began to disintegrate the plot of the play, and to
      discriminate the powers of the dramatis personæ.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my man, step lively,&rdquo; said the officer in his big, husky voice. &ldquo;Do
      you know this Royston McGurny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, Seymour had no cause for suspicion but his own intuition and
      the intangible evidence of tone and look all as obvious to the others as
      to him. But he was at once doubtful and relieved when the haggard wretch
      at the door, mustering his courage, replied: &ldquo;Know Royston McGurny! None
      better. Knowed him all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got pretty good horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got none at all; expect ter borry Mr. Kettison&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go show ye whar the saddle be,&rdquo; exclaimed Meddy, with her wonted
      officious-ness, and glibly picking up the bits of her shattered scheme.
      Seymour fully expected they would not return from the gloom without,
      whither they had disappeared, but embrace the immediate chance of escape
      before the inopportune arrival of the real Barton Smith should balk the
      possibility. But, no,&mdash;and he doubted anew all his suspicions,&mdash;in
      a trice here they both were again, a new courage, a new hope in that
      pallid, furtive face, and another horse stood saddled among the equine
      group at the door. Meddlesome was pinning up the brown skirt of her gown,
      showing a red petticoat that had harmonies with a coarse, red plaid shawl
      adjusted over her head and shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gran&rsquo;dad,&rdquo; she observed, never looking up, and speaking with her mouth
      full of pins, &ldquo;Barton Smith say he kin set me down at Aunt Drusina&rsquo;s
      house. Ye know she be ailin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; sent for me this evenin&rsquo;; but I hed no
      way ter go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff looked sour enough at this intrusion; but he doubtless
      imagined that this relative was no distant neighbor, and as he had need of
      hearty aid and popular support, he offered no protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a clearing sky without, and the wind was laid. The frenzy of the
      storm was over, although rain was still falling. The little cavalcade got
      to horse deliberately enough amid the transparent dun shadows and dim
      yellow flare of light from open door and window. One of the mounts had
      burst a girth, and a strap must be procured from the plow-gear in the
      shed. Another, a steed of some spirit, reared and plunged at the lights,
      and could not be induced to cross the illuminated bar thrown athwart the
      yard from the open door. The official impatience of the delay was
      expressed in irritable comments and muttered oaths; but throughout the
      interval the guide, with his pallid, strained face, sat motionless in his
      saddle, his rifle across its pommel, an apt presentment of indifference,
      while, perched behind him, Meddy was continually busy in readjusting her
      skirts or shawl or a small bundle that presumably contained her rustic
      finery, but which, to a close approach, would have disclosed the
      sulphurous odor of gunpowder. When the cluster of horsemen was fairly on
      the march, however, she sat quite still, and more than once Seymour noted
      that, with her face close to the shoulder of the guide, she was whispering
      in his ear. What was their garnet he marvelled, having once projected the
      idea that this late comer was, himself, the &ldquo;wolf&rsquo;s head&rdquo; whom they were
      to chase down for a rich reward, incongruously hunting amidst his own hue
      and cry. Or, Seymour again doubted, had he merely constructed a figment of
      a scheme from his own imaginings and these attenuations of suggestion? For
      there seemed, after all, scant communication between the two, and this was
      even less when the moon was unveiled, the shifting shimmer of the clouds
      falling away from the great sphere of pearl, gemming the night with an
      incomparable splendor. It had grown almost as light as day, and the
      sheriff ordered the pace quickened. Along a definite cattle-trail they
      went at first, but presently they were following through bosky recesses a
      deer-path, winding sinuously at will on the way to water. The thinning
      foliage let in the fair, ethereal light, and all the sylvan aisles stood
      in sheeny silver illumination. The drops of moisture glittered jewel-wise
      on the dark boughs of fir and pine, and one could even discriminate the
      red glow of sour-wood and the golden flare of hickory, so well were the
      chromatic harmonies asserted in this refined and refulgent glamour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barton Smith!&rdquo; called the sheriff, suddenly from the rear of the party.
      There was no answer, and Seymour felt his prophetic blood run cold. His
      conscience began to stir. Had he, indeed, no foundation for his suspicion?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smith! <i>Smith</i>&rdquo; cried the irascible officer. &ldquo;Hey, there! Is the man
      deaf!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not deef, edzac&rsquo;ly,&rdquo; Meddlesome&rsquo;s voice sounded reproachfully; &ldquo;jes a
      leetle hard o&rsquo; hear in&rsquo;.&rdquo; She had administered a warning nudge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey? What ye want?&rdquo; said the &ldquo;Wolf&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; suddenly checking his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any idea of where you are going, or how far?&rdquo; demanded the
      officer, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just acrost the gorge,&rdquo; the guide answered easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard he had been glimpsed in a hollow tree. That word was telephoned
      from the cross-roads to town. It was the tree the skeleton was in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That tree? It&rsquo;s away back yander,&rdquo; observed one of the posse, reluctant
      and disaffected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he has quit that tree; he is bound for up the gorge now,&rdquo; said the
      guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose you know, from what I was told,&rdquo; said the sheriff,
      discontentedly; &ldquo;but this is a long ja&rsquo;nt. Ride up! Ride up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Onward they fared through the perfumed woods. The wild asters were
      blooming, and sweet and subtile distillations of the autumnal growths were
      diffused on the air. The deer are but ill at road-making,&mdash;such
      tangled coverts, such clifty ledges, such wild leaps; for now the path
      threaded the jagged verge of precipices. The valley, a black abyss above
      which massive, purplish mountains loomed against a sky of pearly tints,
      was visibly narrowing. They all knew that presently it would become a mere
      gorge, a vast indentation in the mountain-side. The weird vistas across
      the gorge were visible how, craggy steeps, and deep woods filled with
      moonlight, with that peculiar untranslated intendment which differentiates
      its luminosity in the wilderness from the lunar glamour &lsquo;of cultivated
      Scenes&mdash;something weird, melancholy, eloquent of a meaning addressed
      to the soul, but which the senses cannot entertain or words express.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sudden halt, the guide dismounted. The girl still sat on the
      saddle-blanket, and the horse bowed his head and pawed. The posse were
      gazing dubiously, reluctantly, at a foot-bridge across a deep abyss. It
      was only a log, the upper side hewn, with a shaking hand-rail held by
      slight standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we got to cross this?&rdquo; asked the officer, still in the saddle and
      gazing downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef ye foller me,&rdquo; said the guide, indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was ahead of his orders. He visibly braced his nerves for the
      effort, and holding his rifle as a balancing-pole, he sped along the light
      span with a tread as deft as a fox or a wolf. In a moment he had gained
      the farther side.
    </p>
    <p>
      They scarcely knew how it happened. So unexpected was the event that,
      though it occurred before their eyes, they did not seem to see it. They
      remembered, rather than perceived, that he stooped suddenly; with one
      single great effort of muscular force he dislodged the end of the log,
      heaved it up in the air, strongly flung it aside, whence it went crashing
      down into the black depths below, its own weight, as it fell, sufficing to
      wrench out the other end, carrying with it a mass of earth and rock from
      the verge of the precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses sprang back snorting and frightened; the officer&rsquo;s, being a
      fine animal in prime condition, tried to bolt. Before he had him well in
      hand again, the man on the opposite brink had vanished. The sheriff&rsquo;s
      suspicions were barely astir when a hallooing voice in the rear made
      itself heard, and a horseman, breathless with haste, his steed flecked
      with foam, rode up, indignant, flushed, and eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whyn&rsquo;t ye wait for me, Sher&rsquo;ff? Ye air all on the wrong track,&rdquo; he cried.
      &ldquo;Boyston McGurny be hid in the skellington&rsquo;s tree. I glimpsed him thar
      myself, an&rsquo; gin information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff gazed down with averse and suspicious eyes. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this!&rdquo;
       he said sternly. &ldquo;Give an account of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; exclaimed the man in amazement. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m Barton Smith, yer guide,
      that&rsquo;s who. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m good for five hundred dollars&rsquo; reward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the sheriff called off the pursuit for the time, as he had no means of
      replacing the bridge or of crossing the chasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meddlesome&rsquo;s share in the escape was not detected, and for a while she had
      no incentive to the foolhardiness of boasting. But her prudence diminished
      when the reward for the apprehension of Boyston McGurny was suddenly
      withdrawn. The confession of one of the distillers, dying of tuberculosis
      contracted in prison, who had himself fired the fatal shot, had
      established the alibi that McGurny claimed, and served to relieve him of
      all suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He eventually became a &ldquo;herder&rdquo; of cattle on the bald of the mountain and
      a farmer in a small way, and in these placid pursuits he found a contented
      existence. But, occasionally, a crony of his olden time would contrast the
      profits of this tame industry at a disadvantage with the quick and large
      returns of the &ldquo;wild cat,&rdquo; when he would &ldquo;confess and avoid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, that&rsquo;s all true; but a man can&rsquo;t holp it no ways in the
      world whenst he hev got a wife that is so out-an&rsquo;-out meddlesome that she
      won&rsquo;t let him run ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; the law, nohow he kin fix it.&rdquo;

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
